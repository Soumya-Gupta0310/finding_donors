    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "Application:-\n",
    "Decision trees help organisations in taking necessary decisions by visualising all the possible actions that can follow a particular decision and the final outcome for the chosen decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performs well:-\n",
    "The model works well when the number of samples is very large with respect to the number of features and turns out to be a good candidate when explainability of the results is an important factor.\n",

    "Performs poorly:-\n",
    "The model works poorly when we have a very high number of features but not enough number of data points. In such cases, the model tends to overfit the data i.e. performs well for the training set by memorizing the data but performs poorly for the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choosing:-\n",
    "We have a good number of samples available to train our data with and the training time of decision tree classifier is quite less compared to other classifiers like SVM, GradientBoostingClassifier etc. These factors make decision tree a good candidate for this problem.\n",

    "The model works poorly for small datasets as bootstrapping becomes significantly less effective for small datasets and each of the weak learners(i.e. decision trees) tend to overfit.\n",

    "Reason for choosing:-\n",
    "We have a good number of samples available to train our data with and using bootstrapping of the data samples to form individual weak learners follwed by aggreation of their results by some kind of voting mechanism will help to reduce overall variance and as a result, we can expect a good accuracy and fbeta score.\n",

    "Among the three models namely DecisionTree, RandomForest and Adaboost mentioned above, DecisionTree and RandomForest are clearly overfitting the data which can be observed from the difference in accuracy scores of these models in the training set and testing set. For training set, their accuracy score is around 0.96-1.00 but for the testing set, it falls to 0.80-0.82. The same thing is observed in case of f-score as well. So, these two are probably not very good choices for the problem.\n",
    "            On the contrary, The performance of AdaboostClassifier is comparable for both training and test set as far as the accuracy score is concerned. Also, the F-Score of Adaboost classifier(0.72) on testing is better than Decision Tree(0.62) and Random Forest(0.67) when 100% of the data is used. Although the training and prediction time of Adaboostclassifier is a little higher than the rest of the models, its performance metrics makes it a winner over the other two models."

    "Adaboost which stands for adaptive boosting is a popular boosting classifier. Adaboost is an iterative procedure, where each data point has equal weight i.e. equal probability of getting selected in the sample in the first iteration. Next iteration onward, the distribution of the training data changes adaptively i.e. based on the result of the previous prediction. The data points which were incorrectly classified by the previous learner are assigned higher weight i.e. higher probability of getting selected in the training sample and it is also ensured that the learner is heavily punished(i.e. a high cost is attributed) if these data points are again classified incorrectly. In this way, we try to reduce the number of misclassified data points in each iteration. \n",
    "    After all the weak learners are trained, we combine their results by some kind of voting mechanism depending on the accuracy of each weak learner. In this way, we can obtain a stable prediction model by reducing the bias and variance of individual weak learner.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Example:-\n",
    "            \n",
    "            A student is asked to attempt 10 questions(each carrying equal marks) out of which he answers 6 correctly. In the next exam , the same student is again asked to attend 10 questions but the weightage of the questions he answered incorrectly in the previous exam were increased. This is repeated for each examination i.e. it is ensured that, the questions the student incorrectly answers in an exam are assigned higher probability to be repeated in the next exam and also with a higher weightage(i.e. incorrectly classifying these questions once again will result in higher deduction of marks). In this way, the student is forced to focus on the difficult questions and the accuracy of the student is adaptively improved. So, in our case, the questions can be treated as data points and the performance of a student in an individual exam can be compared to the performance of an individual weak learner on a particular subset of data."

Instead, I predicted occupation and education as two other important features which are indrectly related to the extra features(hours-per-week and education-num) present in the actual plot. I predicted \"age\" to be the most important or decisive feature and the plot also confirms that the feature \"age\" actually has the highest feature weight. So, the predictions for most important features seem to be very close to the actual plot."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

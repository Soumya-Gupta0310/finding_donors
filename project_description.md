## Project Overview
In this project, supervised learning techniques were applied on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. The data was explored at first to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques were applied to manipulate the data into a workable format. After data preprocessing was complete, several supervised learners were fitted on the data without doing any kind of parameter tuning, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, the model that performed best(in terms of accuracy and fscore) was chosen and optimized with the help of GridSearch. Finally, The optimized model and its predictions on the test data were explored. Its accuracy and fscore were compared with those of the unoptimized model. Finally, 5 most important features were chosen and the optimized model was refitted on these 5 features only. Again, the fscore and accuracy on the test data was checked.
